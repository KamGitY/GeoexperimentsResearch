\title{Computes the weights to be used in the weighted linear model used to
estimate ROAS.}
\usage{
ComputeLinearModelWeights(response, epsilon = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{response}{a vector of the response in the pre period. Length equal to
the number of geos. Must be all nonnegative.}

\item{epsilon}{(number) a small positive increment to add to 'response' to
avoid 1 / 0.}
}
\value{
A vector of weights of the same length as 'response'.
}
\description{
Computes the weights to be used in the weighted linear model used to
estimate ROAS.
}
\note{
If a component of 'response' tends to infinity, the corresponding
weight tends to 0 (i.e., the corresponding data point is ignored).
